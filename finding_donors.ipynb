    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "            I will like to walk you through all three models from worst to best.Support Vector Machine did a fairly good job on the training set and on the testing set even better than Stochastic Gradient Descent as seen by accuracy score and F score.But the time taken by the SVMs is far more than the other two algorithms including both the training set and the testing set, it took more than 7 min on the training set and about a min on the testing set on our 100% sample data.So it is pretty obvious to ruled out the SVMs first.Now the second best model for me was Stochastic Gradient Descent. It did a far better job with respect to support vector machines when we consider the time consumption(SGD took just about 0.498 on the training set and 0.014 the testing set on 100% sample data) of both the algorithms though it lags a little bit behind on the accuracy score and the F score but overall comparing everything it did a better job than the SVMs.\n",
    "            Now for our final and the best model AdaBoost algorithm. It is the best algorithm to choose for this dataset. Adaboost model did a better job in predicting values as it can be seen from the accuracy score and the F score both on the training set and the testing set on nearly all three samples percentages.Though AdaBoost algorithm lags a liitle bit behind the SGD algorithm on the time consuption but the difference is not very large(just about a second except the training on 100% sample which Adaboost took about 9 sec more than SGD) so its a tradeoff we can do as the Adaboost algorithm gives 12% - 14% more accuracy and F score on the training and the testing set than SGD.\n",
    "            Thus Adaboost will work best for our model considering its good accuracy score and F score with reasonable time consuption and fine working with our high dimentional model.\n",

    "    The problem set requires to best predict whether or not a person makes more than 50K dollars as they are more chances of them to donate.So its is clearly a classification problem that is our algorithm need to best predict that whether or not a given person makes more than 50K based on the data already present with us about him/her. So we need to apply classification algorithms, but many of such algorithms are weak classifiers. Adaboost is a boosting algorithm a part of Ensemble Learning. It trains data with such multiple weak classifiers(Classifiers that work better than random guessing but not that very well)and combines the result.The output is not as same as when using a single such classifier. AdaBoost handles choosing the training set for each new classifier based on the results of the previous classifier by looking at instances where it predicted poorly and prioritizing the correct prediction of those instances in the next round of training. It gives weights to different classifiers based on their importance and contribution to the overall algorithm for the best fit(results).\n"

    "-These scores are better than the unoptimized model(Scores increased by near 13%).\n",
    "A large difference can be clearly seen in the above code when I compared the value of Accuracy and F score between Naive preictor and our optimized model.There is a large increment in the accuracy score and F score(accuracy score increased by nearly 62% and F-score increased by nearly 44%).This shows that our model works much more than just randomly guessing everyone as a donar as in Naive predictor,thus a step towards MACHINE LEARNING."

    "## Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "1. Education-num - High educational qualification leads to better and well paid jobs.\n",
    "2. Occupation- Some occupations have high salary than others.\n",
    "3. Capital gain - Higher the capital gain, it means they are more likely to have enough money to invest in the first place.Therefore they can be potential donar.\n",
    "4. Age- Older people tend to have more money as more time you had to use the benefits of above features.\n",
    "5. Native Country- Opportuinies can vary from county to country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly educational qualification and occupation which you are in does play a very important role in you jobs and paid salary.Capital gain will be the second feature to have importance as it shows you have enough money to invest them in the first place so therefore it is more likely for you to have money for donations i.e you are likely to have well paid income >50K.Third I have considered age to be a factor to be considered as with time people tend to progress in their jobs and there salary increases they are more likely to have taken beneifts of the above features.And lastly native countries as different countries have different need and opportuinies some may have huge technical feild with good average employee salary and some countries may not have such an infrastructure yet for the technical feild so there average employee salary could be lower."

    "These five features does closely resemble what I predicted in question 6 except for capital loss and hours per week.As of my prediction education num,capital gain and age all these features played a very important role in our dataset as seen from the visualization they all have resonalble feature weights and cumulative weights.What I didnt considered at that time was hours per week and capital loss which does make sence now as capital loss does have an opposite impact of capital gain. Secondaly hours per week also played a major role in our model as I can see now more hours could lead to more income."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
